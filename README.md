# 📚 RAG From Scratch — Learning Notebook

A simple, educational implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) built from scratch. This notebook demonstrates core RAG concepts step-by-step, perfect for understanding how RAG works under the hood without complex frameworks.

---

## 📝 What's Inside
This notebook walks through:
1. **Loading documents** into memory
2. **Chunking text** into overlapping segments for better retrieval
3. **Creating embeddings** with Sentence Transformers
4. **Performing similarity search** with cosine similarity
5. **Retrieving top-k chunks** relevant to a query
6. **Integrating with an LLM** (Groq's `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`) for final answers

---

## 🛠 Tech Used
- **Python**
- **SentenceTransformers** for embeddings
- **Groq API** for LLM inference
- **Cosine Similarity** for retrieval
- **Jupyter Notebook** for step-by-step learning
